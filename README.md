```

## dev_macos.sh

Installs common dev tools for macOS using Homebrew and Casks. Needs to be updated to add more tools but a good functional starting point.

## virtualhost.sh

Creates a virtual host file. The script can take one or more argument in the form of domain name, like `mydomain.com`.
e.g:

```bash
bash virtualhost.sh domain1.com domain2.com domain3.com
```

For every domain, the script:

- creates directory structure
- grants permissions
- creates demo `index.html` for virtual host
- creates new virtual host file
- enables the new virtual host file

The script also restarts Apache after all domains are set up.

Execute remotely:

```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aamnah/bash-scripts/master/setup/virtualhost.sh | bash -s mydomain.com
```

with `sudo` 

```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aamnah/bash-scripts/master/setup/virtualhost.sh | sudo bash -s mydomain.com
```

Notes:

- The `PHPINIDir` directive in the virtual host conf file will give an Apache config test failed error if PHP is not installed on the system. Either install PHP (why not?) or remove the directive.
- Sets the directory ownership for the user who ran the script
